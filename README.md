# Helio Salon
This is a mockup of an earlier project I worked on designing a salon website.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

This project wa sheavily focused on HTML and CSS as this was language I wanted to practice at the time. There is also some Javascript and SASS but most of this was utilized from templates.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what my experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. This project helped me strengthen a lot of my CSS skills and learned how to make my site more animated for the user.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
